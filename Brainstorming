Rough brainstorming:

Goal
- Satisfy this definition of a computer.
   - An electric device that can preform instructions via memory and data manipulation for input-output purposes.
- Find the square root of a number.

Ways of Finding a square root
- long division
- prime factorization
- repeated subtraction (only works for perfect squares)
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Methods_of_computing_square_roots#Iterative_methods_for_reciprocal_square_roots

Ideas
- Include floating point?
- User input
   - Directional Buttons?
   - Select Button
- Seven segment display
- Serial display

SqRt(Ver.1)
- A serial screen for seeing input binary number
- Left and Right directional buttons for traversing binary number
- 1/0 button to change selected number to opposite number (0 -> 1 & 1 -> 0)
- Alt button to display the binary number as a decimal number
- Sub button to start calculating square root of the number currently inputted
